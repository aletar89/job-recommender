About the job
Letâ€™s face it: out-of-pocket expenses suck. And manual expense spreadsheets are old-school. No one wants to wait until payday to be reimbursed for something they bought for work, and finance teams have better things to do than spend hours tapping away on Excel. At Pleo, weâ€™re on a mission to change this. Weâ€™re here to make spend management surprisingly effective and empowering â€“ for finance teams and employees.

Weâ€™re doing away with an outdated business process to end out-of-pocket spending, encourage autonomy and give finance teams trust in employees. You'll be selling the SaaS tool (company spending solution) that comes with physical pre-paid cards that are then distributed to all employees of the company. But Pleoâ€™s about more than just paying for stuff. Youâ€™ll be helping our customers simplify and streamline their invoices, reimbursements, subscriptions â€“ the lot.

As our first ever Technical Solution Engineer, your primary responsibilities will be to support Pleo customers in creating custom integrations, how to use the product, and being the technical interface for customers from scoping to go live.

What will you be doing?
Support Pleoâ€™s customers in creating custom integrations using Pleoâ€™s APIs to fit their process and system needs.
